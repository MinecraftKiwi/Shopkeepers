# - 'print-listeners': Prints the registered listeners for the first call of

# - 'shopkeeper-activation': Enables debugging output related to shopkeeper
#    activation.
# - 'regular-tick-activities': Enables debug output related to shopkeeper
#    ticking activities that may be considered non-exceptional, and might occur
#    regularly and therefore cause debug spam otherwise. This includes, for
#    example, the activity of teleporting shopkeepers back into place, or
#    updating a shopkeeper's location when a mobile shopkeeper NPC moved
#    around.
# - 'visualize-shopkeeper-ticks': Visualizes the ticking activities of
#    shopkeepers in-game.
# - 'commands': Enables additional commands related debugging output.
# - 'owner-name-updates': Logs information when updating stored shop owner
#    names.
# - 'item-migrations': Logs whenever a shopkeeper performs item migrations (eg.
#    for trading offers).
# - 'item-conversions': Logs whenever we explicitly convert items to Spigot's
#    data format. Note that this does not log when items get implicitly
#    converted, which may happen under various circumstances.

save-instantly: true

# Enables the automatic conversion of items inside the inventories of players
# and shop containers whenever a player opens a shopkeeper UI (eg. trading,
# editor, hiring, etc.) The items are converted to conform to Spigot's internal
# data format.
# This setting helps with issues related to items which have been created on
# previous Spigot versions or via some Minecraft mechanism (eg. give command,
# loot tables, etc.) no longer getting accepted when trading with shopkeepers.
# In order for the items to get reliably accepted during trades, their data has
# to match the internal format which Spigot uses when a plugin would create the
# same items via the Spigot API. Spigot occasionally makes changes to this
# internal data format. Any previously created items, or newly created items
# which don't conform to this new format, may cause trading and item stacking
# issues then.
# This setting is intended to help with the portion of the issue affecting
# shopkeeper trades. This setting will not reliably help you prevent item
# stacking related issues!
# Enabling this setting comes with a performance impact! Try to avoid using
# this option and search for alternative solutions instead (eg. stick to
# Spigot's data format when creating items via Minecraft mechanisms). Try to
# only keep this setting enabled for as long as required (eg. until you assume
# that most of your players' legacy items got converted by now).

# Whether shopkeeper mobs shall not be affected by gravity.
disable-gravity: false
# The range in chunks around players in which shopkeeper mobs will be affected
# by gravity. Setting this too high may have a negative impact on performance.
# And setting it below the server's entity tracking range will result in
# players being able to see mobs floating in mid air until they get close
# enough. A value of 0 will limit the gravity to mobs within chunks that
# contain a player. This has no effect if gravity is disabled.
gravity-chunk-range: 4

# The number of Minecraft ticks between behavior updates of shopkeeper mobs.
# This controls the rate at which we update the gravity and AI of shopkeeper
# mobs. Values above 1 indicate a reduced tick rate and result in a less
# smooth, less reactive, and possibly slower behavior in comparison to the
# behavior of mobs in vanilla Minecraft.
# In order to compensate for a reduced tick rate some activities may be scaled
# accordingly. This ensures, for example, that mobs still rotate their head at
# the same speed towards nearby players, or that mobs still fall at the same
# speed when being affected by gravity.
# Consequently, a reduced tick rate is less performance-intensive in total, but
# may on the other hand be slightly more performance-intensive per individual
# behavior update.

# * Adding "(?i)" at the front enables case insensitive matching.
# * "(?=X)": The name has to match "X" (X can be another embedded expression),
